<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

<p>PrayFirst ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>Information you provide:</strong> When you use PrayFirst, you may provide personal information during onboarding including your name, age range, gender, faith background, and prayer preferences. This information is stored locally on your device to personalize your experience.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer content:</strong> Prayers generated by the app and any prayer topics you enter are stored locally on your device. We do not store your prayers on our servers.</p>

<p><strong>Usage data:</strong> We may collect anonymous usage data such as app opens, feature usage, and crash reports to improve the app experience. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>Your personal information is used solely to:</p>
<p>• Personalize your prayer experience (using your name, mood, and preferences)<br>
• Generate AI-powered prayers tailored to your situation<br>
• Track your prayer streaks and reading progress<br>
• Improve the app experience</p>

<h2>AI Prayer Generation</h2>
<p>When you generate a prayer, your mood selection, optional prayer topic, and general preferences are sent to Google's Gemini API to create a personalized prayer. We do not send your full name or identifying information to the AI service. No prayer content is stored on external servers after generation.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>All personal data, prayers, streaks, and preferences are stored locally on your device using secure on-device storage. We do not maintain a database of your personal information on our servers.</p>

<h2>Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
<p>Subscription purchases are processed through Apple's App Store. We use RevenueCat to manage subscription status. We do not have access to your payment information, credit card details, or Apple ID. Please refer to Apple's privacy policy for information about how they handle payment data.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>PrayFirst uses the following third-party services:</p>
<p>• <strong>Google Gemini API</strong> — for AI prayer generation<br>
• <strong>RevenueCat</strong> — for subscription management<br>
• <strong>Superwall</strong> — for paywall presentation<br>
• <strong>Expo/EAS</strong> — for app updates</p>
<p>Each service has its own privacy policy governing how they handle data.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>PrayFirst is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

<h2>Data Deletion</h2>
<p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete all your data at any time by uninstalling the app. You can also reset your data from the Profile tab within the app.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
